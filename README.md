GaussLegendre.m > Returns the Gauss-Legendre (GL) nodes and weights for numerical integration.

LGLDiffMtrx.m > Returns the differentiation matrix for the Lobatto-Gauss-Legendre (LGL) interpolation points. 
This matrix, when multiplied by a vector containing the value at the interpolation points, yields a vector containing the values of the derivative of the interpolation polynomial at the interpolation points.

LobattoGaussLegendre.m >  Returns the LGL nodes and weights for numerical integration.

PoissonCollocation.m > Solves the Poisson equation with homogeneous boundary conditions via the collocation method

PoissonVariational.m > Solves the Poisson equation with homogeneous boundary conditions via the variational method

RungePhenomenom.m > A simple example showing how LGL nodes avoid Runge's classical counterexample
